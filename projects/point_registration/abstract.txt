Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in computer graphics and more specifically, in rigid and non-rigid shape matching. The rigid shape matching problem can be formulated as the problem of simultaneously aligning and labelling two point clouds in 3D so that they are as similar as possible. We name this problem the Procrustes matching (PM) problem. The non-rigid shape matching problem can be formulated as a PM problem in higher dimension using the functional maps method. High dimensional PM problems are difficult non-convex problems which currently can  only be solved locally using iterative closest point (ICP) algorithms or similar methods. So far, good initialization for the local algorithms was obtained by relying on user input.

We introduce a novel and efficient convex SDP relaxation for the PM problem. We prove that for (generic) isometric or almost-isometric problems the algorithm returns a correct global solution of the problem.

We show our algorithm gives state of the art results on popular shape matching datasets. We also show that our algorithm gives state of the art results for anatomical classification of shapes. Finally we demonstrate the successfulness of our method in aligning shape collections.
