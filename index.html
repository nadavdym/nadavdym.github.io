Recently, there has been a growing interest in neural architectures that are invariant or equivariant to all three shape-preserving transformations of point clouds: translation, rotation, and permutation. In this paper, we present a first study of the approximation power of these architectures. We first derive two sufficient conditions for an equivariant architecture to have the universal approximation property, based on a novel characterization of the space of equivariant polynomials. We then use these conditions to show that two recently suggested models are universal, and for devising two other novel universal architectures.">Abstract</a>

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Stable Phase Retrieval from Locally Stable and Conditionally Connected Measurements" abstract="This paper is concerned with stable phase retrieval for a family of phase retrieval models we name `locally stable and conditionally connected' (LSCC) measurement schemes. For every signal f, we associate a corresponding weighted graph G_f, defined by the LSCC measurement scheme, and show that the phase retrievability of the signal f is determined by the connectivity of G_f. We then characterize the phase retrieval stability of the signal f by two measures that are commonly used in graph theory to quantify graph connectivity: the Cheeger constant of G_f for real valued signals, and the algebraic connectivity of G_f for complex valued signals.We use our results to study the stability of two phase retrieval models that can be cast as LSCC measurement schemes, and focus on understanding for which signals the `curse of dimensionality' can be avoided. The first model we discuss is a finite-dimensional model for locally supported measurements such as the windowed Fourier transform. For signals `without large holes', we show the stability constant exhibits only a mild polynomial growth in the dimension, in stark contrast with the exponential growth which uniform stability constants tend to suffer from; more precisely, in R^d the constant grows proportionally to d^1/2, while in C^d it grows proportionally to d. We also show the growth of the constant in the complex case cannot be reduced, suggesting that complex phase retrieval is substantially more difficult than real phase retrieval. The second model we consider is an infinite-dimensional phase retrieval problem in a principal shift invariant space. We show that despite the infinite dimensionality of this model, signals with monotone exponential decay will have a finite stability constant. In contrast, the stability bound provided by our results will be infinite if the signal's decay is polynomial.">Abstract</a>

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Quasi Branch and Bound for Smooth Global Optimization" abstract="Quasi branch and bound is a recently introduced generalization of branch and bound, where lower bounds are replaced by a relaxed notion of quasi-lower bounds, required to be lower bounds only for sub-cubes containing a minimizer. This paper is devoted to studying the possible benefits of this approach, for the problem of minimizing a smooth function over a cube. This is accomplished by suggesting two quasi branch and bound algorithms, qBnB(2) and qBnB(3), that compare favorably with alternative branch and bound algorithms.The first algorithm we propose, qBnB(2), achieves second order convergence based  only on a bound on second derivatives, without requiring calculation of derivatives. As such, this algorithm is suitable for derivative free optimization, for which typical algorithms such as Lipschitz optimization only have first order convergence and so suffer from limited accuracy due to the clustering problem. Additionally, qBnB(2) is provably more efficient than the second order Lipschitz gradient algorithm which does require exact calculation of gradients. The second algorithm we propose, qBnB(3), has third order convergence and finite termination. In contrast with BnB algorithms with similar guarantees who typically compute lower bounds via solving relatively time consuming convex optimization problems, calculation of qBnB(3) bounds only requires solving a small number of Newton iterations. Our experiments verify the potential of both these methods in comparison with state of the art branch and bound algorithms.">Abstract</a>

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Expression of Fractals Through Neural Network Functions" abstract="To help understand the underlying mechanisms of neural networks (NNs), several groups have, in recent years, studied the number of linear regions $\ell$ of piecewise linear functions generated by deep neural networks (DNN). In particular, they showed that $\ell$ can grow exponentially with the number of network parameters $p$, a property often used to explain the advantages of DNNs over shallow NNs in approximating complicated functions. Nonetheless, a simple dimension argument shows that DNNs cannot generate all piecewise linear functions with $\ell$ linear regions as soon as $\ell > p$. It is thus natural to seek to characterize specific families of functions with $\ell$ linear regions that can be constructed by DNNs. Iterated Function Systems (IFS) generate sequences of piecewise linear functions $F_k$ with a number of linear regions exponential in $k$. We show that, under mild assumptions, $F_k$ can be generated by a NN using only $\mathcal{O}(k)$ parameters. IFS are used extensively to generate, at low computational cost, natural-looking landscape textures in artificial images. They have also been proposed for compression of natural images, albeit with less commercial success. The surprisingly good performance of this fractal-based compression suggests that our visual system may lock in, to some extent, on self-similarities in images. The combination of this phenomenon with the capacity, demonstrated here, of DNNs to efficiently approximate IFS may contribute to the success of DNNs, particularly striking for image processing tasks,  as well as suggest new algorithms for representing self similarities in images based on the DNN mechanism.">Abstract</a>

Quasi BnB replaces the linear lower bounds used in BnB algorithms with quadratic quasi-lower bounds which are based on the quadratic behavior of the energy in the vicinity of the global minimum. While quasi-lower bounds are not truly lower bounds, the Quasi-BnB algorithm is globally optimal. In fact we prove that it exhibits linear convergence -- it achieves ϵ-accuracy in  O(log(1/ϵ)) time while the time complexity of other rigid registration BnB algorithms is polynomial in 1/ϵ.

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Sinkhorn Algorithm for Lifted Assignment Problems" abstract="Recently, Sinkhorn's algorithm was applied for solving regularized linear programs emerging from optimal transport very efficiently. Sinkhorn's algorithm is an efficient method of projecting a positive matrix onto the polytope of doubly-stochastic matrices. It is based on alternating closed-form Bregman projections on the larger polytopes of row-stochastic and column-stochastic matrices.
                 In this paper we generalize the Sinkhorn projection algorithm to higher dimensional polytopes originated from well-known lifted linear program relaxations of the Markov Random Field (MRF) energy minimization problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). We derive a closed-form projection on one-sided local polytopes which can be seen as a high-dimensional, generalized version of the row/column-stochastic polytopes. We then use these projections to devise a provably convergent algorithm to solve regularized linear program relaxations of MRF and QAP. Furthermore, as the regularization is decreased both the solution and the optimal energy value converge to that of the respective linear program. The resulting algorithm is considerably more scalable than standard linear solvers and is able to solve significantly larger linear programs. ">Abstract</a>

We show that these discrete conformal maps converge to the Riemann mapping uniformly and in $H^1$.

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Robust optimization for topological surface reconstruction" abstract="Surface reconstruction is one of the central problems in computer graphics.
Existing research on this problem has primarily focused on improving the
geometric aspects of the reconstruction (e.g., smoothness, features, element
quality, etc.), and little attention has been paid to ensure it also has desired
topological properties (e.g., connectedness and genus). In this paper, we
propose a novel and general optimization method for surface reconstruction
under topological constraints. The input to our method is a prescribed genus
for the reconstructed surface, a partition of the ambient volume into cells,
and a set of possible surface candidates and their associated energy within
each cell. Our method computes one candidate per cell so that their union is a
connected surface with the prescribed genus that minimizes the total energy.
We formulate the task as an integer program, and propose a novel solution
that combines convex relaxations within a branch and bound framework.
As our method is oblivious of the type of input cells, surface candidates, and
energy, it can be applied to a variety of reconstruction scenarios, and we
explore two of them in the paper: reconstruction from cross-section slices
and iso-surfacing an intensity volume. In the first scenario, our method
outperforms an existing topology-aware method particularly for complex
inputs and higher genus constraints. In the second scenario, we demonstrate
the benefit of topology control over classical topology-oblivious methods
such as Marching Cubes.">Abstract</a>

				</p>
				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Exact Recovery with Symmetries for the Doubly-Stochastic Relaxation (for the full abstract see paper)" abstract="Graph matching or quadratic assignment, is the problem of labeling the vertices of two graphs so that they are as similar as possible. A common method for approximately solving the NP-hard graph matching problem is relaxing it to a convex optimization problem over the set of doubly stochastic (DS) matrices. Recent analysis has shown that for almost all pairs of isomorphic and asymmetric graphs, the DS relaxation succeeds in correctly retrieving the isomorphism between the graphs. Our goal in this paper is to analyze the case of symmetric isomorphic graphs. This goal is motivated by shape matching applications where the graphs of interest usually have reflective symmetry. For symmetric problems the graph matching problem has multiple isomorphisms and so convex relaxations admit all convex combinations of these isomorphisms as viable solutions. If the convex relaxation does not admit any additional superfluous solution we say that it is convex exact.  In this case there are tractable algorithms to retrieve an isomorphism from the convex relaxation. We show that convex exactness depends strongly on the symmetry group of the graphs; For a fixed symmetry group $G$, either the DS relaxation will be convex exact for almost all pairs of isomorphic graphs with symmetry group $G$, or the DS relaxation will fail for all such pairs. We show that for reflective groups with at least one full orbit convex exactness holds almost everywhere, and provide some simple examples of non-reflective symmetry groups for which convex exactness always fails. When convex exactness holds, the isomorphisms of the graphs are the extreme points of the convex solution set. We suggest an efficient algorithm for retrieving an isomorphism in this case.

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="DS++: A Flexible, Scalable and Provably Tight Relaxation for Matching Problems" abstract="Correspondence problems are often modelled as quadratic optimization problems over permutations. Common scalable methods for approximating solutions of these NP-hard problems are the spectral relaxation for non-convex energies and the doubly stochastic (DS) relaxation for convex energies. Lately, it has been demonstrated that semidefinite programming relaxations can have considerably improved accuracy at the price of a much higher computational cost.We present a convex quadratic programming relaxation which is provably stronger than both DS and spectral relaxations, with the same scalability as the DS relaxation. The derivation of the relaxation also naturally suggests a projection method for achieving meaningful integer solutions which  improves upon the standard closest-permutation projection. Our method can be easily extended to optimization over doubly stochastic matrices, partial or injective matching, and problems with additional linear constraints. We employ recent advances in optimization of linear-assignment type problems to achieve an efficient algorithm for solving the convex relaxation.We present experiments indicating that our method is  more accurate than local minimization or competing relaxations for non-convex problems. We successfully apply our algorithm to shape matching and to the problem of ordering images in a grid, obtaining results which compare favorably with state of the art methods. We believe our results indicate that our method should be considered the method of choice for quadratic optimization over permutations  ">Abstract</a>

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Convolutional Neural Networks on Surfaces via Seamless Toric Covers" abstract="The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks is inspiring research efforts attempting to achieve similar success for geometric tasks. One of the main challenges in applying CNNs to surfaces is defining a natural convolution operator on surfaces. In this paper we present a method for applying deep learning to spheretype shapes using a global seamless parameterization to a planar flat-torus, for which the convolution operator is well defined. As a result, the standard deep learning framework can be readily applied for learning semantic, highlevel properties of the shape. An indication of our success in bridging the gap between images and surfaces is the fact that our algorithm succeeds in learning semantic information from an input of raw low-dimensional feature vectors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by presenting two applications: human body segmentation, and automatic landmark detection on anatomical surfaces. We show that our algorithm compares favorably with competing geometric deep-learning algorithms for segmentation tasks, and is able to produce meaningful correspondences on anatomical surfaces where hand-crafted features are bound to fail.

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Exact Recovery with Symmetries for Procrustes Matching" abstract="The Procrustes matching (PM) problem is the problem of finding the optimal rigid motion and labeling of two point sets so that they are as close as possible. Both rigid and non-rigid shape matching problems can be formulated as PM problems. Recently [Maron et al. 2016] presented a novel convex semi-definite programming relaxation (PM-SDP) for PM which achieves state of the art results on common shape matching benchmarks. In this paper we analyze the successfulness of PM-SDP in solving PM problems without noise (Exact PM problems). We begin by showing exact PM to be computationally equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem. We demonstrate some natural theoretical properties of the relaxation, and use these properties  to show that for exact PM problems and for (generic) input shapes which are asymmetric or bilaterally symmetric, the relaxation returns a correct solution of PM. We also show that these results can be extended to the almost-exact case.
				For symmetric shapes, PM has multiple solutions. Convex relaxations of non-convex problems with multiple solutions always admit unwanted solutions- the convex combination of the correct solutions. To avoid this standard approaches condition the non-convex problem so that it has a unique solution. In contrast, we show that the solutions of PM are the extreme points of the convex solution set of PM-SDP. We then suggest a random algorithm which returns a solution of PM with probability one, and return all solutions of PM with equal probability. By repeatingly applying this algorithm all solutions of PM can be obtained. ">Abstract</a>

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Point Registration via Efficient Convex Relaxation" abstract="Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in computer graphics and more specifically, in rigid and non-rigid shape matching. The rigid shape matching problem can be formulated as the problem of simultaneously aligning and labelling two point clouds in 3D so that they are as similar as possible. We name this problem the Procrustes matching (PM) problem. The non-rigid shape matching problem can be formulated as a PM problem in higher dimension using the functional maps method. High dimensional PM problems are difficult non-convex problems which currently can  only be solved locally using iterative closest point (ICP) algorithms or similar methods. So far, good initialization for the local algorithms was obtained by relying on user input. We introduce a novel and efficient convex SDP relaxation for the PM problem. We prove that for (generic) isometric or almost-isometric problems the algorithm returns a correct global solution of the problem. We show our algorithm gives state of the art results on popular shape matching datasets. We also show that our algorithm gives state of the art results for anatomical classification of shapes. Finally we demonstrate the successfulness of our method in aligning shape collections.">Abstract</a>

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Homotopic morphing of planar curves" abstract="This paper presents an algorithm for morphing between closed, planar piecewise-$C^1$ curves. The morph is guaranteed to be a regular homotopy, meaning that pinching will not occur in the intermediate curves.

                The algorithm is based on a novel convex characterization of the space of regular closed curves and a suitable symmetric length-deviation energy. The intermediate curves constructed by the morphing algorithm are guaranteed to be regular due to the convexity and feasibility of the problem.

                We show that our method compares favorably with standard curve morphing techniques, and that these methods sometimes fail to produce a regular homotopy, and as a result produce an undesirable morph.

                We explore several applications and extensions of our approach, including morphing networks of curves with simple connectivity, morphing of curves with different turning numbers with minimal pinching, convex combination of several curves, and  homotopic morphing of b-spline curves via their control polygon.">Abstract</a>
